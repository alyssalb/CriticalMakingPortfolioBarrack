## Critical Making Portfolio - Alyssa Barrack
This website serves as a Critical Making portolio for Alyssa Barrack. I am a PhD student in the Texts and Technology program at UCF, and a theatre artist and events/productions professional. Having spent most of my professional life predominantly in educational theatre, I am accustomed to and interested in process-oriented scholarship that focuses on work that blends scholarly, artistic, aesthetic, pedagogical, and theoretical priorities. This portfolio aims to highlight a variety of skills that bridge the space between research and creation, and offers a perspective of creation as a means of research and research dissemination. This portfolio showcases many competencies in a variety of mediums both digital and material (analog, if you will play with me in extending the metaphor) and acts as a sampling of my ability as an artist-scholar. It is by no means exhaustive -- research-creation (a term borrowed from Natalie Loveless) is my operative mode as a scholar and a professional.

Many of the projects here were undertaken as part of the Critical Making for Humanist Scholarship course at UCF in the Spring 2025 semester.

# Grammar - Procedural Tracery-based Project
This is my absolute favorite project I made in this course. I find such joy in the chance to think about my brilliant friend, who I made this procedural project for. It has inspired me throughout this semester to find spaces where I can center care in my work, whether that is in my research, in my professional life, or even the domestic labor that my home-unit undergoes on the daily. It felt so good to use a labor space in pursuit of sharing care and love and joy with another person, especially someone I hold so close. I am still developing this through practice, but I am interested in adding an element of care into my research - I think this aligns so well conceptually with socially-conscious work like Costanza-Chockâ€™s Design Justice and Your Computer is Not on Fire - to think about the effects and consequences of the things we make is to care for the wellbeing of other humans, both individually and broadly construed.

# Comic - Image-Text
I include this because it helped me work through thoughts for a broader project I did outside of the Critical Making course with the UCF Theatre Department during the same semester. This sketched comic gave me a critical lens that contributed to a view of my work there as an art-scholarship endeavor. Making can help clarify and visualize philosophy in artistic process as scholarship by bringing together image (and physicalization, as some of the stills were captured in the dance-performance) and text/thought, backed up with scholarly sources that had influence on the work.

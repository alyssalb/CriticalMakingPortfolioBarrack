# Hypertext - Twine
This Twine game, exploring the treacherous waters of doing your taxes on your own while occupying a moderately complicated employment situation, is to me a productive and cathartic method of presenting the steps of doing one's own taxes. I am preserving this as a future reference document that I know will be useful for at least one person (myself).

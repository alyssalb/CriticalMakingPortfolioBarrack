# Selfie/Self Portrait
This was a great place to start the journey in the Critical Making course - rooted in materiality. 
I am excited by and comfortable with physical mixed-medium collage, and have that as part of my crafting repertoire, so this exercise was personal to me in that way. It also allowed me to abstract my image in such a way that more accurately captures my essence which has two strong results - 1) I do not feel that this image ties me to assigned gendered descriptors that are unsolicited, and 2) this image expresses my personality as stratified across all facets of my life, and allows me to present myself as I am to a variety of audiences. This was a powerful first activity for me on my Critical Making (or research-creation) journey. 

Below you can see the progress from the original image to the final Self Portrait collage.
